# animeGo_api
My Restful API for my mobile app animeGo. <br>
This RestFul API web scrapes spanish and english anime sites. API Swagger docs will be published soon. <br>
1. Running the web app <br>
All you have to do is to run the Docker compose file for setting the dockers. Then, you can consume the API by your IP. This is because a Nginx image is used as a reverse proxy for the Flask web app deployment. <br>
PD: Ports 80 and 8080 are required.
